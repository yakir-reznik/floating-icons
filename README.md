### How to customize the behavior

Some of the options have a `min` and `max` value (`minDelay` and `maxDelay` for example).
This means when each element is rendered a random value from the range (min to max) will be assigned.

### How to change which emojis (or elements) the function renders

Use the `elements` option to pass an array of possible elements to render.

```typescript
import useFloatingIcons from "floating-icons";

useFloatingIcons({
  target: "#my-el",
  elements: [
    { content: "‚ù§Ô∏è", probability: 3 },
    { content: "üòÑ", probability: 2 },
    { content: "üëçüèª", probability: 1 },
    { content: "‚úåüèª", probability: 1 },
  ],
});
```

For each item in the array specify the "content" to render and a probability to render the item.

When elements are being rendered a random element item will be selected from the array based on its probability divided by the total probability value.

For the example above theres a 3 / 6 chance a "‚ù§Ô∏è" will be selected.
a 2/6 chance that a "üòÑ" will be selected.
and 1/6 chance for the rest of the items.

That means that if you render 6 elements you would most likely get 3 "‚ù§Ô∏è", 2 "üòÑ", 1, "üëçüèª", "‚úåüèª".
Since the selection is random the amounts and their location in the animation will change for each invocation of the function.

This results in an effect that appears new and exciting every time.

### How to use with existing element or with fixed screen coordinates

In order to render the effect on an existing element you can specify the elments selector or a reference to the element.

```typescript
import useFloatingIcons from "floating-icons";

// Using with a selector
useFloatingIcons({
  target: "#my-btn",
});

// Using with an element reference
const myBtn = document.querySelector("#my-btn");
useFloatingIcons({
  target: myBtn,
});

// Using with coordinates (positioned using positin:fixed)
useFloatingIcons({
  target: {
    x: "200px",
    y: "300px",
  },
});
```

The effect will be rendered in the center on the target element or the specified screen coordinates as shown in the image below.

![Centering example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5369b829-33a5-453d-8b0d-5316a141aab8)

### How to use with your own html content

Instead of using emojis you can specify your own html elements in the elements.content option.

```typescript
import useFloatingIcons from "floating-icons";

const myFirstHTMLElement = document.querySelector("#my-first-html-element");
const mySecondHTMLElement = document.querySelector("#my-second-html-element");

useFloatingIcons({
  target: "#my-el",
  elements: [
    {
      content: myFirstHTMLElement,
      probability: 1,
    },
    {
      content: mySecondHTMLElement,
      probability: 1,
    },
  ],
});
```

### Methods

`destroy`: destroys the animation element.
this function is called automatically after the animation has finished.
You can call it manually if you want to destory the element before the animation is complete.

```typescript
import useFloatingIcons from "floating-icons";

const floatingIcons = useFloatingIcons({ target: "#my-btn" });

setTimeout(() => {
  floatingIcons.destroy();
}, 1000);
```

### Basic usage with React

```jsx
import useFloatingIcons from "floating-icons";

export function MyBtn() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
     <button onClick={(e) => {
          useFloatingIcons({
            target: e.currentTarget as HTMLElement,
            debug: false,
            density: 0.6, // range from 0.0 - 1
            distanceToTravel: '100px',
            minDelay: 0, // ms
            maxDelay: 800, // ms
            minDuration: 500, // ms
            maxDuration: 1500, // ms
            minElementCount: 8, // number
            maxElementCount: 12, // number
            minRotation: -15, // degrees
            maxRotation: 15, // degrees
            minSize: '20px',
            maxSize: '40px',
            opacity: 1, // range from 0.0 - 1
            wiggle: '10px', // sizeUnit
            zIndex: 0,
          });
        }}
      >
      Click me!
    </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
